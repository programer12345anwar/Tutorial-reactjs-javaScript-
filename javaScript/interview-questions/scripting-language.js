✅ What is a Scripting Language?
A scripting language is a type of programming language used to write scripts—short programs that automate tasks, control other software, or enhance existing systems. These languages are typically:

Interpreted, not compiled (executed line by line at runtime).

Used for automation, web development, task execution, etc.

Easier to write and understand compared to system-level programming languages.

Examples include JavaScript, Python, Bash, PHP, Ruby, etc.

✅ Is JavaScript a Scripting Language?
Yes, JavaScript is a scripting language.

Originally, JavaScript was created to add interactivity to web pages (a scripting task), and it runs inside browsers using an interpreter (like V8 or SpiderMonkey). Over time, it evolved into a powerful programming language used on both client-side and server-side (via Node.js), but it is still categorized as a scripting language because:

It's interpreted (though modern engines use JIT compilation).

It's mainly used to control or extend the behavior of environments (browsers, servers).

It was designed to script web pages, not to build standalone applications like C/C++ or Java initially.
